## Reflection
- 36 lines of code -> 11,676,770 points 
- 281th place in United Kingdom.

We were doing quite well (on the top10 in our hub, in UCL TechSoc UK) but finally dropped to number 15. Looking back we lost quite some quality time with reading the input files properly and assigning to variables; we would need to have a framework/skeleton that we could use next time for easier I/O.

On the same page, there's been a lot of lost time while trying to look and convert between the numpy data structures and our easiest to handle mathematical data types (which kind of cancel the whole idea of using numpy on the first hand).
